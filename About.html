            <p>The Quran, also spelled as Koran, is the holy book of Islam, revered by Muslims worldwide as the divine
                word of God, as revealed to the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) over 1,400 years ago. It is written
                in Arabic and is considered a literary masterpiece due to its eloquence and linguistic beauty. The Quran
                is divided into chapters, known as Surahs, which vary in length and cover a wide range of topics,
                including theology, morality, law, and guidance for personal conduct. It is not merely a religious text
                but also serves as a comprehensive guide for Muslims, providing insight into every aspect of life and
                spirituality. Muslims believe that the Quran is the final and unaltered revelation from God and that its
                teachings provide the ultimate source of wisdom and guidance for adherents seeking to lead a righteous
                and fulfilling life. The Quran's profound impact on history, literature, and human thought is
                immeasurable, making it a source of inspiration and enlightenment for millions around the globe.</p>
